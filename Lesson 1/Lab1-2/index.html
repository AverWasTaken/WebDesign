                <p>When desiging a website to be viewed on a computer, you it is important to take into account the different browsers that your<br>visitors might be using.

                <p>When desiging for tablets, one must remember that tablets are nagivated by  touch and generally have smaller screen sizes. The<br>links must be separated, or large enough, so that when a link is touched, only the desired page opens. It can be very frustrating<br>for a visitor to your site to have difficulties getting the right link to open because they are positioned so close together. The<br>screen sizes of tablets are also an area to consider. Generally they are smaller than laptop or monitor screens, therefore you<br>should consider the layout size of your content. It is difficuly and unnatural to scroll sideways on a tablet so you want to make<br>sue that everytjing fits within the width of the tablet screen.</p>

                <p>Making your website compatible with smart phone screens can be difficut. Some website desgners recommend creating a<br>seperate site designed just for mobile devices becuase desiging a site that is compatible for the phone, which would mean the<br>longer screen width, larger links, and limited information on the pages.</p>

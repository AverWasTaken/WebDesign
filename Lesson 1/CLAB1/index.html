                <p>A web designer is an indivudal that makes their living by designing and maintaining web sites. This is a field that has evolved extremely quickly over the past decade, <br> but the fundamentals still remain the same. Any web designer must have a strong understanding of the HTML launguage. Conterary to what most poeple believe HTML is <br> not a programming language, but a formatting language developed by <strong>Tim Burners-Lee</strong> in 1989. Since its original development HTML has come a long way and has <br> incorporated a multitude of new features. HTML allowed for the development of the World Wide Web and the explosive popularity of the Internet!</p>
                <p>As HTML evelved, developers soon realized that the structure of web pages should be defined using HTML, adn the pages style, look, and feel, should be defined <br> separately, thus the birth of cascading style sheets. Now developers use HTML to define what the information on the web page is, such as a heading conent, article <br> content, a paragraph within the article, or footer content, etc. Cascading sheets were designed to define the colors of document, the size, margins, colors, and positioning <br> of the various elements of the web page.</p>
                <p>About the time the HTML and  the World Wide Web were hitting the public sector, PHP was being developed to make web pages a more powerful tool. PHP is a <br> scripting language that is written directly on the web page and interpreted by the web server which would send the final version of the web page to the visitor's browser. <br> About a year later, <storng>Netscape</storng> released the first version of JavaScript, under the name Mocha which later became LiveScript, and then JavaScript. Javascript is also a <br> scripting language, but unlike PHP, JavaScript is interpreted by the visitors browser rather than the web server. As a result JavaScript is not as powerful as PHP and lacks <br> the ability to interaact with a database, but still porivdes processing functionality to a web page, Web designers now days must not only be proficient in HTML and CSS, <br>  but a variety of scripting language as well. Even thoguh HTML was the first language of the web, maybe more have come along, but it still remains the fundamental <br> structure that the web page is built from.</p>
